College – Student – Company Placement Platform

SkillBridge is a B2B & B2C placement platform that bridges the gap between colleges, students, and companies by enabling verified skill-based hiring instead of traditional CGPA-based recruitment.

📌 Problem Statement

  Companies struggle to identify job-ready talent from the right colleges.

  Colleges lack a centralized platform to showcase verified student skills.

  Students are unaware of skill gaps required for specific roles.

  Existing platforms focus on individuals, not college-level verified data.

  Colleges verify student profiles and achievements

  Companies search students using skill & ATS filters

  Students track ATS scores, skill gaps, mock tests, and courses

  AI (Google Gemini) assists with career guidance & doubt clarification
